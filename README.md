# hashing_methods
Project 5 - CSC 103

The following project will use three different hashing methods to place names within a text file into a hash table.
The program will test the following methods:
  - Linear Probing
  - Double Hashing
  - Chain hashing
  :
The program will then output the number of collisions that occur per name and the collision frequency for all three methods.
